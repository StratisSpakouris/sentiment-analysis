# sentiment-analysis
  Simplistic sentiment analysis of a Shakespeare's play, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. The play contains 5 acts, each with 2 scenes, and the task is to investigate them, and in particular to decide how positive or negative each scene is.

  To that end, there are two more data files: positive-words.txt and negative-words.txt, which contain lists of positive and negative words respectively. These words come from the paper Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. "Mining and summarizing customer reviews." Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, Seattle, Washington, USA, Aug 22-25, 2004. So whilst the words are not ideal for our purpose (since they are mainly to do with product review sentiments), they still represent an interesting way to examine our scenes.
